Because manual activities don\u2019t scale, GRC practitioners find themselves settling for low quality outputs, toiling away at producing mediocre outcomes that only affect or pertain to small fragments of an organization\u2019s security and privacy programs.</p> <p>For example: the practice of requiring screenshots for producing evidence of control effectiveness (\u201cmake sure your system clock is visible!\u201d) or the practice of periodic look-back analyses (change management reviews, user access reviews, etc.), neither of which scale in ways that allow for demonstrating holistic control effectiveness, timely detection and correction of control deviations or failures, etc.</p> Transactional GRC-centric stakeholder relationships <p>Stakeholders and their needs aren\u2019t fully accounted for or appreciated in GRC programs. They are often treated solely as \u201cproviders\u201d of GRC activity inputs rather than consumers of what GRC provides to them. GRC teams tend to only reach out to stakeholders once a quarter or once a year when it\u2019s time to produce evidence of a control or review and approve a policy. A mindset of \u201cwhat do I need from this stakeholder and when do I need it\u201d prevails over a more customer-centric one of \u201chow can I make it as easy as possible for this stakeholder to uphold their responsibilities and achieve their goals in the context of GRC?\u201d</p> <p>Likewise, GRC tools, processes, data, and experiences are tailored to the needs, desires, and opinions of GRC teams. This creates friction between teams, misinformed thinking within GRC, missed opportunities to create more effective solutions, and frustrating experiences for GRC teams and GRC stakeholders alike.</p> <p>For example: purpose-built risk register web applications that provide a UI and UX that are barely tolerable for GRC practitioners and that are beyond intolerable for software developers, IT admins, executives, and other organizational stakeholders. Rather than being able to collaborate with cross-functional stakeholders within their risk register, GRC practitioners are forced to live in their siloed tool, integrate with a separate work management tool (e.g. Jira, Asana, Monday, etc.), and sync items as needed for stakeholders to consume. This results in avoidable waste. </p> Shallow &amp; narrow problem solving mindset <p>Legacy GRC programs treat symptomatic issues in a whack-a-mole fashion without more deeply understanding and addressing root cause problems. This can be due to ignorance of how security risks manifest in the context of plausible threat activity; ignorance of what incentivizes stakeholder behavior; and/or ignorance of how reporting and ownership structures within an organization drive resource allocation and work execution. This leads to inefficient collaboration, continuous confusion between GRC teams and their stakeholders, and a lagging GRC goal achievement.</p> <p>For example: mandating file integrity monitoring (FIM) as a must-have compliance requirement without consideration for alternative controls, relevant threat models, and workload architecture, resulting in lots of noise and increased user friction with little to no security assurance value added. Additionally, struggling to get GRC work prioritized by solely working directly with individual contributors or team managers, overlooking how senior leadership and/or other teams (e.g. Product Management) play a bigger role in work prioritization decisions. </p> Excessive focus on closed source frameworks &amp; standards <p>Highly static frameworks and industry standards \u2013 typically developed by small, disparate, closed-off, and slow-moving \u201cauthority\u201d organizations \u2013 are too often seen as an end state to achieve (\u201cwe need to be compliant with CIS benchmarks!\u201d or \u201cwe\u2019ll use NIST 800-53 as our control set\u2026because!\u201d). The incredible sprawl of disparate-yet-overlapping frameworks has inevitably led to a growing number of meta-frameworks. This inundation of industry standards has stifled independent and creative thinking among the GRC and InfoSec community, paralyzing our ability to keep pace with a constantly evolving problem space. </p> <p>Legacy GRC programs struggle to account for relevant threat models, workload designs, and organizational context when prescribing policies, standards, procedures, and controls. We are encumbered with ineffective and sometimes regressive solutions that fail to mitigate plausible and probable risks while creating unnecessary friction for stakeholders. </p> <p>For example: endlessly advocating for the \u201cindustry standard\u201d practice of removing users\u2019 local administrator access and implementing deny-by-default application allowlisting to protect against malware, while ignoring the obvious reality that these legacy approaches to endpoint and identity security controls would undermine organizations\u2019 ability to innovate and thus would never be tolerated. This results in missed opportunities to explore alternative controls that are much likelier to be successfully implemented in an organization, such as decentralized peer reviewed application allowlisting and self-service just-in-time access (JITA) privilege escalation (here's an example of this for Windows).</p> Commoditization of compliance <p>While the advent of compliance automation products and low-cost audits have boosted GRC\u2019s efficiency, the same cannot be said about the impact they\u2019ve had on GRC\u2019s effectiveness. In other words: automating and streamlining Legacy GRC practices simply results in producing low-value outcomes faster. In this context, GRC is largely, if not entirely, valued as a sales enabler or a \u201ccover-your-ass\u201d necessity rather than as foundational for having strong security and privacy practices that sustainably improve organizational outcomes and customer value.</p> <p>For example: SOC 2 Type II audits are notorious for being inherently open ended \u201ctests\u201d of an organization's controls. In cases where a low cost audit provider is used, it can be akin to a student writing both the questions and answer key for an exam, providing that to the teacher, and the teacher grading their answers accordingly. Organizations have long been incentivized to pass their audits with no findings so as to not disrupt sales. Audit providers have been incentivized to be \u201cflexible\u201d to ensure their customers are happily provided a passing audit and keep giving them their business. Vendor due diligence teams are pressured to approve vendors and accept industry standard audit results without much, if any, additional scrutiny, treating it as a \u201crigorous\u201d examination of an organization\u2019s controls. New GRC automation products merely speed up this perversely incentivized cycle without creating stronger incentives to improve controls beyond checkbox compliance.</p>"},{"location":"#values","title":"Values","text":"<p>A value is something that has relative worth, merit, or importance.

Building and using solutions for your own problems creates an immediate feedback loop that allows for faster and more intelligent iteration around feature development, UI/UX enhancements, and defect resolution. We have seen this be the case with best-in-class open source security solutions that have been developed by practitioners across other security domains over the years: Metasploit for offensive security, osquery for endpoint security, Trufflehog for credential security, Velociraptor for threat hunting, etc. We can and should do the same for GRC tools, concepts, and frameworks.</p> GRC as a product <p>When treated as a product as opposed to a service, GRC provides demonstrably beneficial business, mission, security, and assurance outcomes - beyond GRC\u2019s primary use cases.

Systems thinking allows us to more effectively do this by understanding problems in a more holistic context of an overarching system, i.e. things that interact and interrelate in ways that produce patterns of behaviors. Systems thinking can substantially augment GRC activities such as risk identification, analysis, and assessment; control design, monitoring, and testing; governance and process engineering; etc. </p> <p>When combined with systems thinking, design thinking allows us to ideate and implement highly effective solutions in ways that</p> <ul> <li>empathetically account for stakeholders\u2019 experiences and needs</li> <li>embrace participatory approaches to solution development; and </li> <li>emphasize rapid prototyping and frequent solution iteration to incrementally deliver value to stakeholders, early on and often</li> </ul> <p>Synthesizing these two thinking styles can unlock new levels of efficiency and effectiveness for any GRC program.</p>"},{"location":"#authors","title":"Authors","text":"<ul> <li>Ayoub Fandi</li> <li>Akshay Finney</li> <li>Austin Rust</li> <li>Charles Nwatu</li> <li>Emre Ugurlu</li> <li>Justin Pagano</li> <li>Terra Cooke</li> <li>Varun Gurnaney</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#grc-engineering-resources","title":"GRC Engineering Resources","text":"<ul> <li>GRC Engineering Podcast</li> <li>Awesome Security GRC List</li> <li>Varun Gurnaney\u2019s Medium</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#get-involved","title":"Get Involved!","text":"<p>Join our LinkedIn Group </p> <p>Contribute in GitHub </p>"},{"location":"#get-involved_1","title":"Get Involved!","text":"<p>Join our LinkedIn Group </p> <p>Contribute in GitHub </p> <p>Join our Discord </p>"},{"location":"projects/","title":"Projects","text":"<p>Coming soon...</p>"}]}
